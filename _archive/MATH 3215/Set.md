Usually denoted with capital letters
Elements are denoted with capital letters
Null set $\emptyset$
Universal Set $\Omega$ 
- Universal set's scope is understood within the context

Commutative 
$A\cap B=B\cap A$
Associative Law
$(A\cup B)\cup C=A\cup (B\cup C)$
Distributive
$A\cap(B\cup C) =(A\cap B)\cup(A\cap C)$

De Morgan's Laws
$(A\cup B)^c=(A^c\cap B^c)$


#### Counting Techniques
Complement Rule $|A^C|=|\Omega|-|A|$
Inclusion Exclusion: $|A\cup B|=|A|+|B|-|A\cap B|$
$A\cup B\cup C=|A|+|B|+|C|-|A\cap B|-|A\cap C|-|B\cap C|+|A\cap B\cap C|$
##### Multiplication Principle
If r steps that are to be performed are such that the first step can be performed in $n_{1}$ ways, second can be performed in $n_{2}$ ways, and so on, then the total number of ways to perform all the steps is $n_{1}\cdot n_{2}\cdot \ldots \cdot n_{r}$
${A}\choose {B}$
##### Addition Principle
$A\cup B=|A| + |B|$ if $A,B$ are disjoint.
