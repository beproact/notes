Every perfect randomized algorithm can be derandomized
Randomized algorithms must have error

#### Monte Carlo
Always stops hopefully in polytime.
Gives the right answer 99% of the time.
#### Las Vegas
Eventually is expected to give right answer. Always right if it does.

#### Primality Testing
Given $n_{1}$ does n have a factor f f|n

If n is k bits the $2^O(k)$
Use fermats little theorem.
$a^{n-1}=1\mod p$ then n is probably prime. Called rabin miller test.

Carmichael numbers exist. Pass rabin miller test, but aren't prime.
