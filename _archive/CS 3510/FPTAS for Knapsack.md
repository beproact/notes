Approximation Scheme
AS takes as input additional $\epsilon$ error
$\epsilon_{0}=.1$
PTAS means polytime in nj
FPTAS means polytime in both n and $\frac{1}{\epsilon}$


FPTAS alogorithm
```python
FPTAS KS(W,I,e):
	if wi > W discard item
	
```


A runtime is pseudo polynomial if the input in unary makes it polynomial

There exists an FPTAS for an NP-Complete problem if and only if it is pseudo polynomial.
