CPI "Cycles per Instruction"
Execution time = $\Sigma$CPI * clock cycle time
Tough to compute
Execution time = $n*CPI_{Avg}*$clock cycle time

Static instruction frequency - number of times a particular instruction occurs in compiled code.
Dynamic instruction frequency - Refers to the frequency of occurrence of instructions that are actually executed

# Improving Performance
Reduce execution time by reducing instructions, CPI or Cycletime.
